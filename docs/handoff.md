# Limitaur handoff

Updated 2026-10-20 (America/Los_Angeles). Discussion IDs continue from P328.

## Product state

Compact-bars source is accepted at `ab8b5e6` (P119, closed). At that commit 133 automated tests passed: 72 native Swift, 49 independent Python tests under Adversarial/, AdversarialClaude/ and AdversarialBars/, and 12 collector tests. The 49 independent tests are frozen; do not edit them to fit future code. New scope needs new tests.

Native app: Swift/AppKit, macOS 26+, no runtime dependencies, menu-bar only. See README.md for behaviour, commands and what is verified versus unverified.

## P73 versioning: done (2026-10-20, commits 9f42eb5 and 6116935)

The earlier release-platform design is retired and archived under `docs/archive/p73-release-platform/`. Do not resume it. The implemented scope, reviewed cold by gpt-6-astra and claude-opus-5-5 (see `docs/reviews/p73-version-review.md`), is:

- one version constant in `Sources/Limitaur/AppVersion.swift`, hand-edited, SemVer;
- `--version` prints it and exits before AppKit starts; About Limitaur… in Settings shows it;
- `scripts/build-app.sh` stamps that version, a git commit count and the HEAD revision into Info.plist, signs ad-hoc and writes a sha256 of the executable next to the bundle;
- `CHANGELOG.md` in keep-a-changelog form, no validator;
- native tests for the version string, early exit, the real executable's dispatch and the About callback.

Tests after P73: 79 native Swift, 49 frozen independent Python, 12 collector, all passing.

Dropped by decision: Python packaging tool, artifact identity manifest, tracked-source digest, changelog validator, build-tool plugin, blind AdversarialPackaging suite, sandbox harness for this increment. The 50 external AdversarialRelease tests target the retired design and stay outside the repository.

## Labelled bars (P323–P327, 2026-10-20)

Approved and implemented per `docs/labelled-bars.md`: jars with provider glyph and window code, optional local logo images, `windowCode(for:)` in LimitaurCore. Static renders inspected at 1x and zoomed in both appearances. The operator ran the built bundle on 2026-10-20: both Codex and Claude fetched successfully from the app bundle, Claude via Keychain, so the app-bundle provider-access gate is informally cleared; the other gates remain.

## Still pending, in order

1. Release gates, all manual on this machine and unverified: actual menu-bar anchoring, click, keyboard, scroll, light/dark, increased contrast and accessibility labels; Codex and Claude fetch from the built app bundle, especially Claude Keychain access; default SwiftBuild backend build; sustained performance (60 s warmup plus 600 s measured, both providers, max RSS under 50 MiB, mean one-core CPU under 0.1%). Never grant OS access automatically.
2. API-metered accounts and hybrid credit use: not approved. Last contract draft is external at `/Users/ivan/ws/limitaur-review/2026-10-18-01a15018/claude-continuation/additions-design.md`; its detailed contract was not approved.
3. Cursor: deferred.

## Rules of the road

No push without explicit approval in the current turn. No install, login item, tag, release, credential copy or auth write. Claude is used as a normal CLI with its existing login. Evidence directories live under `/Users/ivan/ws/limitaur-review/`.
